# Business Discovery, Booking & Analytics — End-to-End Feature Spec

## What This Document Is

A complete feature specification for the Supper app's business-to-consumer flow — from discovery to booking to reviews to analytics. Use this as the single source of truth when implementing or extending business features.

---

## 1. Business Discovery via Home Search

### Goal
When a user types a natural-language query (e.g., "water bottle near me", "haircut under 500", "yoga classes this weekend"), businesses with matching products or services appear as results in the home/discovery screen — alongside regular user posts.

### How It Works (Current Architecture)

```
User types: "water bottle near me"
       ↓
UnifiedPostService.createPost()
       ↓
Gemini AI analyzes intent:
  - action_type: "seeking"
  - domain: "marketplace"
  - complementary_intents: ["selling water bottles", "retail store"]
  - keywords: ["water", "bottle", "near"]
       ↓
Generates 768-dim embedding
       ↓
UnifiedMatchingService compares against ALL posts (including business sync posts)
       ↓
Business "ShopName" has catalog item "Steel Water Bottle ₹299"
  → Their synthetic offering post matches with score ≥ 0.60
       ↓
Result surfaces in discovery feed
```

### What Needs to Work

| Requirement | Detail |
|-------------|--------|
| **Search results show businesses** | When a user's seeking intent matches a business's catalog/services, that business card appears in results |
| **Business card in results** | Shows: business name, soft label, cover image, rating stars, distance (if location available), top matching item(s) with price |
| **Tap business card** | Opens business profile with full catalog, hours, reviews, "Book" / "Message" / "Connect" actions |
| **Real-time sync** | When a business adds/removes catalog items, their discovery post updates automatically (via `syncBusinessPost`) |
| **Location-aware** | Businesses closer to the user get a location bonus in matching score |

### Key Files

- `lib/services/unified_post_service.dart` — intent analysis + business post sync
- `lib/services/unified_matching_service.dart` — scoring algorithm
- `lib/screens/home/` — discovery/home screen
- `lib/screens/near_by/near_by_screen.dart` — nearby tab with Businesses filter

## 3. Booking Flow (End-to-End)

### Customer Journey

```
Step 1: Customer finds business via search or discovery
Step 2: Taps a service/product in catalog
Step 3: Sees service detail: name, price, duration, description
Step 4: Taps "Book Now"
Step 5: Selects date + time slot
Step 6: Adds optional notes ("I need it for 2 people")
Step 7: Confirms booking → status: PENDING
Step 8: Business owner gets notification
Step 9: Owner confirms → status: CONFIRMED (customer notified)
Step 10: Service delivered → Owner marks COMPLETED
Step 11: Customer gets prompt to leave a review
```

## 6. Profile Views Tracking

### How It Works (Already Implemented)

```
Customer views business profile
       ↓
CatalogService.logProfileView(profileOwnerId, viewerId, viewerName, viewerPhotoUrl)
       ↓
Creates document in users/{ownerId}/profileViews/{viewId}
       ↓
Increments businessProfile.profileViews counter
       ↓
Owner sees view count on dashboard + viewer list
```

### Existing UI

`ProfileViewsScreen` in `lib/screens/business/simple/profile_views_screen.dart`:
- Total view count
- List of viewers with name, photo, timestamp

---

## 7. Notification Triggers

| Event | Who Gets Notified | Message |
|-------|-------------------|---------|
| New booking created | Business owner | "New booking from {customerName}" |
| Booking confirmed | Customer | "{businessName} confirmed your booking" |
| Booking cancelled | Other party | "Booking cancelled by {name}" |
| Booking completed | Customer | "Your booking is complete. Leave a review!" |
| New review | Business owner | "New {n}-star review from {name}" |
| Owner response to review | Reviewer | "{businessName} responded to your review" |
| Profile viewed | (Optional) | "{viewerName} viewed your profile" |
| Connection request | Business owner | "New connection request from {name}" |

---

## 8. Full User Journey (End-to-End Example)

```
1. DISCOVERY
   Rahul opens Supper → types "water bottle near me"
   → AI understands: seeking, marketplace, keywords: water bottle
   → Matches against business posts
   → "AquaStore" appears (has "Steel Water Bottle ₹299" in catalog)
   → Shows: business card with name, rating, distance, matching item

2. BUSINESS PROFILE
   Rahul taps AquaStore card
   → Sees full business profile: catalog, hours, reviews
   → Profile view logged for AquaStore owner
   → Browses catalog, sees "Steel Water Bottle ₹299"

3. BOOKING (for services) or MESSAGING (for products)
   Option A — Service: Rahul taps "Book" on a service item
   → Picks date/time → adds notes → confirms
   → Booking created (PENDING) → AquaStore owner notified

   Option B — Product: Rahul taps "Message"
   → Conversation created with business chat metadata
   → Discusses product availability, delivery, etc.

4. BUSINESS OWNER SIDE
   AquaStore owner opens app → sees notification badge
   → Goes to Bookings dashboard → sees Rahul's booking
   → Taps "Confirm" → Rahul gets notified
   → Later marks "Completed" → Rahul prompted to review

5. REVIEW
   Rahul gets "Leave a Review" prompt
   → Rates 5 stars, writes "Great quality bottle!"
   → Review saved → AquaStore rating recalculated
   → Owner sees review → writes response: "Thank you Rahul!"

6. ANALYTICS
   AquaStore owner checks dashboard:
   → Profile views: 1,247 (+15 today)
   → Catalog views: 3,891
   → Bookings this month: 23
   → Average rating: 4.5 (128 reviews)
   → Recent: "Rahul left a 5-star review"
```

  │
  ├── catalog/{itemId}        — Products & services

  ├── userId, title, description
  ├── embedding[768], keywords

---

## 11. Key Constraints

1. **No hardcoded categories** — AI determines intent dynamically
2. **Catalog sync is automatic** — `syncBusinessPost()` called after every catalog change
3. **Max 100 catalog items** per business
4. **Bookings are immutable** — only status/notes/cancelReason can change
5. **Reviews prevent duplicates** — one review per customer per business
6. **Rating auto-recalculates** — no manual intervention needed
7. **Profile views skip self-views** — owner viewing own profile doesn't count
8. **Business hours are timezone-aware** — `isCurrentlyOpen` uses device time
9. **Always use `limit()` on Firestore queries** — never unbounded reads
10. **Use `FirebaseProvider`** — never create new Firebase instances

---

## 12. Detailed Implementation Plan (Phase-by-Phase)

### PHASE 1: Business Discovery in Home Search

**Goal:** When user searches "water bottle near me", business results appear with matching catalog items.

**File to modify:** `lib/screens/home/home_screen.dart`

**What happens now:**
- User types query → `UnifiedIntentService` processes → matches returned as `MatchResult` list
- Results displayed as generic profile cards — no distinction between personal and business posts
- Business sync posts (`metadata.isBusinessPost == true`) exist but render identically to personal results

**What to add:**
1. In the result rendering section, check `matchResult.postData['metadata']['isBusinessPost'] == true`
2. If business post: render a **BusinessResultCard** widget instead of generic card
3. BusinessResultCard layout:
   ```
   ┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
   │ [Cover Image / placeholder gradient] │
   │ ● Open Now                           │
   ├──────────────────────────────────────┤
   │ 🏪 Business Name        ★ 4.5 (128) │
   │ Retail Store  •  1.2 km away         │
   ├──────────────────────────────────────┤
   │ Matching items:                      │
   │ ┌─────────┐ ┌─────────┐             │
   │ │ 📦 Item │ │ 📦 Item │             │
   │ │ ₹299    │ │ ₹499    │             │
   │ └─────────┘ └─────────┘             │
   ├──────────────────────────────────────┤
   │     [View Business]  [Message]       │
   └──────────────────────────────────────┘
   ```
4. Data to fetch: use `matchResult.userId` to get `UserProfile` (has businessProfile embedded)
5. Fetch matching catalog items: `CatalogService().getAvailableItems(userId, limit: 3)`
6. On tap → navigate to `PublicBusinessProfileScreen(userId: matchResult.userId)`

**Card colors:** dark: `Color(0xFF1C1C1E)`, light: `Colors.white`, border radius: 12
**Open badge:** Green `#22C55E` for open, Red for closed
**Rating stars:** Amber `#F59E0B`

**DO NOT change:** Any service logic, matching algorithm, or post creation flow.

---

### PHASE 2: Public Business Profile Screen

**Goal:** Customer-facing profile showing catalog, hours, reviews, and action buttons.

**New file:** `lib/screens/business/simple/public_business_profile_screen.dart`

**Data loading on init:**
```dart
// All from existing services — NO new service methods needed
final userProfile = await FirebaseFirestore.instance.collection('users').doc(userId).get();
final catalogItems = await CatalogService().getAvailableItems(userId, limit: 50);
final ratingSummary = await ReviewService().getRatingSummary(userId);
// Log the profile view (skips self)
CatalogService().logProfileView(userId, currentUserId, currentUserName, currentUserPhoto);
```

**Screen layout (CustomScrollView with Slivers):**
```
SliverAppBar (expandedHeight: 200)
  └── Cover image (CachedNetworkImage) with gradient overlay
  └── Business name + soft label overlay
  └── Open/Closed badge (from BusinessHours.isCurrentlyOpen)
  └── Rating: ★ {averageRating} ({totalReviews} reviews)

SliverToBoxAdapter — Action Row
  └── [Message] [Book Service] [Call]
  └── Message → ConnectionService or direct conversation creation
  └── Call → url_launcher tel:{contactPhone}

SliverToBoxAdapter — About Section
  └── description text, address, business hours

SliverToBoxAdapter — "Catalog ({count} items)" header
SliverGrid — Catalog items (2-column grid using CatalogCardWidget)
  └── Each item taps → CatalogItemDetail.show() (existing modal)

SliverToBoxAdapter — "Reviews ({count})" header
SliverList — Top 3 reviews + "See All Reviews →" link
  └── StreamBuilder using ReviewService().streamReviews(userId)

SliverToBoxAdapter — Business Hours section
  └── 7-day schedule from businessProfile.hours
  └── Highlight today's hours, show "Open Now" / "Closed"
```

**Existing patterns to follow:**
- Card style: match `business_hub_screen.dart` (dark: `0xFF1C1C1E`, radius: 12)
- Typography: `AppTextStyles` (Poppins, standard hierarchy)
- Image: `CachedNetworkImage` with placeholder
- Snackbar: `SnackBarHelper.showSuccess/Error`
- Dark/light: `Theme.of(context).brightness == Brightness.dark`

---

### PHASE 3: Booking Creation Flow

**Existing file:** `lib/screens/business/simple/booking_request_screen.dart` — ALREADY BUILT

**What it has:**
- Customer name (pre-filled from auth)
- Phone number (optional)
- Date picker (min: tomorrow, max: 90 days)
- Time picker
- Notes textarea
- Validation + loading state
- Calls `BookingService().createBooking(booking)`
- Success/error snackbar

**What may need enhancement:**
1. Pre-populate service details (name, price, duration) from the tapped `CatalogItem`
2. Show service summary at top of form (image, name, price, duration)
3. After successful booking → navigate to customer bookings list (Phase 4)
4. Verify it passes all required `BookingModel` fields correctly

**Entry point:** From `CatalogItemDetail` → "Request Booking" button (already wired)

---

### PHASE 4: Customer Bookings List ("My Bookings")

**New file:** `lib/screens/business/simple/customer_bookings_screen.dart`

**Data:** `BookingService().streamCustomerBookings(currentUserId)` — returns Stream<List<BookingModel>>

**Layout (match existing bookings_screen.dart pattern):**
```
TabBar: [Upcoming] [Completed] [Cancelled]

Upcoming tab (pending + confirmed):
  StreamBuilder → filter status == pending || confirmed
  Each card:
    ┌────────────────────────────────────┐
    │ Business Name          [Status]    │
    │ Service: Haircut                   │
    │ 📅 March 15, 2026  🕐 2:00 PM    │
    │ ₹500                              │
    │                    [Cancel Booking]│
    └────────────────────────────────────┘

Completed tab:
  Each card + [Leave Review] button (if !hasUserReviewed)
  Check: ReviewService().hasUserReviewed(businessOwnerId, currentUserId)

Cancelled tab:
  Simple list with cancel reason if available
```

**Status badge colors:**
- Pending: Amber `#F59E0B`
- Confirmed: Blue `#3B82F6`
- Completed: Green `#22C55E`
- Cancelled: Red `#EF4444`

**Navigation access:**
- Add "My Bookings" option in user profile screen or via a menu item
- Also accessible after booking creation (Phase 3 success flow)

---

### PHASE 5: Owner Bookings Dashboard

**Existing file:** `lib/screens/business/simple/bookings_screen.dart` — ALREADY BUILT

**What it has:**
- 3 tabs: Pending | Confirmed | History
- StreamBuilder with `BookingService().streamOwnerBookings()`
- Booking cards with customer avatar, name, phone, service, date/time
- Status chips (color-coded)
- Action buttons on cards

**What may need enhancement:**
1. Verify Pending tab has [Confirm] + [Decline] buttons calling `BookingService().updateBookingStatus()`
2. Verify Confirmed tab has [Mark Complete] button
3. Add pending count badge to "Bookings" quick action in `business_hub_screen.dart`
   - Use `BookingService().getPendingCount(ownerId)` for badge count
4. Verify notifications fire on status changes (already in BookingService)

---

### PHASE 6: Review Submission & Display

**Existing files:**
- `write_review_screen.dart` — Star rating + text + submit (BUILT)
- `reviews_screen.dart` — Rating summary + review list (BUILT)

**What may need enhancement:**

1. **Write review screen:**
   - Add optional category ratings (Communication, Quality, Value) — star rows
   - Link to booking if applicable: `isVerifiedPurchase: true`, `serviceId`, `serviceName`
   - Check `ReviewService().hasUserReviewed()` before showing — prevent duplicates
   - Photo upload option (ReviewModel supports `images` list)

2. **Reviews on public profile (Phase 2):**
   - Show top 3 reviews inline on public business profile
   - "See All" → navigate to full `ReviewsScreen`
   - Show owner responses (`businessResponse`) below each review

3. **Owner review management:**
   - In `reviews_screen.dart`, add "Reply" button on each review card
   - Reply form → calls `ReviewService().addOwnerResponse(reviewId, text)`
   - Show existing response with edit capability

---

### PHASE 7: Business Analytics Dashboard

**File to modify:** `lib/screens/business/simple/business_hub_screen.dart`

**What exists now:**
- Quick action grid (Catalog, Bookings, Reviews, Views icons)
- Catalog grid below
- Profile completeness bar
- Business name/label/status header

**What to add — Analytics section above quick actions:**

**Data sources (all existing, no new methods):**
- `businessProfile.profileViews` — profile view count
- `businessProfile.catalogViews` — catalog view count
- `businessProfile.averageRating` — star rating
- `businessProfile.totalReviews` — review count
- `BookingService().getPendingCount(userId)` — pending bookings
- `BookingService().streamOwnerBookings(userId)` — total booking count

**Stat card colors:**
- Views: Purple `#8B5CF6`
- Catalog: Blue `#3B82F6`
- Bookings: Green `#22C55E`
- Reviews: Amber `#F59E0B`
- Pending: Red badge overlay

**Badge counts on quick action icons:**
- Bookings icon → show pending count as red badge
- Reviews icon → optionally show new review count

## 13. Code Patterns Reference

### Theme check (REQUIRED on every screen)
```dart
final isDark = Theme.of(context).brightness == Brightness.dark;
final bgColor = isDark ? const Color(0xFF000000) : const Color(0xFFF5F5F7);
final cardColor = isDark ? const Color(0xFF1C1C1E) : Colors.white;
final textColor = isDark ? Colors.white : Colors.black;
final subtitleColor = isDark ? Colors.white.withOpacity(0.7) : Colors.black.withOpacity(0.6);
```

### Card pattern
```dart
Container(
  decoration: BoxDecoration(
    color: cardColor,
    borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(12),
    boxShadow: isDark ? null : [
      BoxShadow(color: Colors.black.withOpacity(0.08), blurRadius: 8, offset: Offset(0, 2)),
    ],
  ),
)
```

### Service singleton usage
```dart
// CORRECT — factory constructor returns singleton
CatalogService().getAvailableItems(userId);
BookingService().createBooking(booking);
ReviewService().submitReview(review);
ReviewService().addOwnerResponse(reviewId, text);

// WRONG — never do this
final service = CatalogService();  // This IS fine (returns singleton via factory)
// But never use: CatalogService._internal() or new CatalogService()
```

### StreamBuilder pattern
```dart
StreamBuilder<List<BookingModel>>(
  stream: BookingService().streamOwnerBookings(userId, filter: 'pending'),
  builder: (context, snapshot) {
    if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
      return const Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator());
    }
    if (snapshot.hasError || !snapshot.hasData || snapshot.data!.isEmpty) {
      return _buildEmptyState();
    }
    final items = snapshot.data!;
    return ListView.builder(...);
  },
)
```

### Navigation pattern
```dart
Navigator.push(context, MaterialPageRoute(
  builder: (_) => PublicBusinessProfileScreen(userId: businessUserId),
));
```

### Snackbar feedback
```dart
SnackBarHelper.showSuccess(context, 'Booking confirmed!');
SnackBarHelper.showError(context, 'Failed to submit review');
```

### Mounted check in async
```dart
await someAsyncOperation();
if (!mounted) return;
setState(() { ... });
```

### Empty state pattern
```dart
Widget _buildEmptyState(String icon, String title, String subtitle) {
  return Center(
    child: Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        Icon(icon, size: 48, color: Colors.grey),
        SizedBox(height: 16),
        Text(title, style: AppTextStyles.titleMedium),
        SizedBox(height: 8),
        Text(subtitle, style: AppTextStyles.bodySmall.copyWith(color: Colors.grey)),
      ],
    ),
  );
}
```

## 14. Firestore Security Rules (Verified)

All rules exist in `firestore.rules`:

| Collection | Read | Create | Update | Delete |
|-----------|------|--------|--------|--------|
| `bookings/{bookingId}` | Customer OR owner | Customer only (customerId == auth.uid) | Either party — status/notes/cancelReason only | ❌ Never |
| `business_reviews/{reviewId}` | Any authenticated | Reviewer (rating 1-5 validated) | Reviewer edits OR owner adds response only | Reviewer only |
| `users/{id}/catalog/{itemId}` | Any authenticated | Owner only | Owner only | Owner only |
| `users/{id}/profileViews/{viewId}` | Owner only | Any authenticated | ❌ Never | ❌ Never |
| `businesses/{businessId}` | Any authenticated | Owner only | Owner only | Owner only |

**Immutable booking fields (protected by rules):** customerId, businessOwnerId, serviceId, servicePrice
